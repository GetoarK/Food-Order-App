# Project Food Order App

The project displays lists of available meals to order and enables you to place a number of orders in a cart. 

The cart enables you to adjust the amount of orders for the meals added to the cart and the meals are also grouped automatically.

Future development will include:

- Improved design
- http requests for more meals (with pagination included)
- Address information and embedded map with a pin on the correct coordinates
